# Basic Movie Search App with SvelteKit


## Description

Decided to try out SvelteKit and see how its like to build a web application with this new framework. Really impressed by how straight forward it is, especially with the file-based routing and just how easy it is to implement reactivity, and even animations. The TMDB API was used for movies.
